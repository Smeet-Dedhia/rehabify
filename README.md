# What we provide?
We have 4-way approach for users to rehabilitate from their addiction:

### <b> 1. DAST Test </b> <br>
Digital Addiction Screen Test is a test based on phycological evaluation of a person’s experience with addictive substances. It is a clinical approach to analyse drug abuse severity made by expert. We conduct DAST test for all users to better understand the severity and give them the right kind of help.

### <b> 2. Gamified Incentives for positive habits </b><br>
We track users daily progress with avoiding substances. The user receives reward points when they avoid substances. This gamifies positive habits and thus helps the users. Highest continuous streak, success ratio, overall progress are some of the statistics that motivate the user.

### <b> 3. User Forums & Support Groups</b><br>
With Clustering ML models, we group similarly suffering people into groups so that they can receive mutual motivation and personalized guidance from mentors.

### <b> 4. Video Consultation Booking</b><br>
Users can select an available slot on the platform. They are mapped to a Medical Professional/Counsellor. An email is generated with the virtual details and emailed to the user.

# We are proud to highlight our Standout Features:

### <b>1.	Privacy & Security with ML & NLP</b> <br>
We use ML & NLP algorithms to obscure sensitive personal details like names so that anonymity & privacy of the users is maintained.
    
### <b>2.	ML clustering algorithm</b> <br>
We group similar users into groups using ML – clustering algorithms. This makes it easier for users to meet similar users as well as mentors and experts to provide personalized treatment.
